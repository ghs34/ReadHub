## Testing Plan

This testing plan ensures the application is thoroughly evaluated for quality, functionality, and performance, delivering a reliable and seamless user experience.

### 1. Workflow
The testing workflow includes:
- **Linting**: Ensuring code quality and enforcing style guidelines using `pylint`.
- **Testing**: Validating individual components, interactions, and functions using `pytest`.
- **Coverage Analysis**: Measuring test coverage with `pytest-coverage` to identify untested code paths.

### 2. Test Levels
The test levels are organized in a structured folder within the project:
```
└── tests/
     ├── functional/
     │    ├── unit/
     │    └── integration/
     └── non-functional/
          ├── system/
          └── performance/
```

#### Functional Requirements

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Focuses on individual components or subroutines without connecting to the larger system.
   - Validates backend CRUD operations for entities like users, books, and comments.
   - Tests helper functions, utility modules, and input validation logic.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Ensures interactions between modules (e.g., API endpoints and database).
   - Verifies API endpoints for correctness and expected responses.
   - Tests database interactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
   - Includes both:
     - **White Box Testing**: Focus on internal code structures.
     - **Black Box Testing**: Verify functionality without internal code knowledge.

3. **System Testing**:
   - Validates the interaction of all components.
   - Ensures end-to-end functionality, covering UI, backend, and database.
   - Includes:
     - Authentication and authorization workflows.
     - Search functionality with filters and suggestions.
     - User profile and library management features.
     
#### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - Uses `pylint` to identify coding errors and enforce best practices.

2. **Usability Testing**:
   - Validates UI components like form validation, error messages for invalid input, and required/optional fields.
   - Tests navigation links (internal and external) to ensure seamless user experience.

3. **Security Testing**:
   - Validates data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and authorization.
   - Tests secure handling of cookies and session data.
   - Ensures protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

4. **Cookie Testing**:
   - Validates cookie creation, expiration, and secure transmission over HTTPS.

5. **Compatibility Testing**:
   - Ensures the application works across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

6. **Performance Testing**:
   - **Web Load Testing**: Tests system behavior under expected loads.
   - **Stress Testing**: Evaluates system performance under extreme conditions.

7. **Exploratory Testing**:
   - Ad-hoc testing to uncover unexpected issues through unscripted scenarios.

### 3. Testing Strategies

1. **Smoke Testing**:
   - Preliminary tests focusing on core functionalities.
   - Ensures critical features work before deeper testing begins.

2. **Regression Testing**:
   - Re-runs all functional and non-functional tests to ensure no new defects are introduced after updates.

### 4. Test Environment

- **Simulated Production Environment**: Mirrors the live environment to validate application behavior.
- **Test Data**: Includes realistic datasets for testing CRUD operations, user interactions, and edge cases.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Tracks test results, coverage, and performance metrics.
